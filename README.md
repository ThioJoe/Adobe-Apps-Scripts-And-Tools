## [Path Points to Ellipse](Scripts/Photoshop/Path-Points-To-Ellipse.jsx)

- **Purpose:** Draw 6 path points (or more) using the pen tool, and the script will create an Ellipse shape layer such that the outline matches the points as close as possible.

- **Requirements:** [Numeric.js](Scripts/Photoshop/includes/numeric.js) (Script will offer to automatically download)
